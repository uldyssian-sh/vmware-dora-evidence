### Installation Methods

#### Package Installation
```bash
pip install vmware-dora-evidence
```

#### Source Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uldyssian-sh/vmware-dora-evidence.git
cd vmware-dora-evidence
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install

```

### Configuration

#### Basic Configuration
```yaml
vmware:
  vcenter_host: "vcenter.example.com"
  username: "dora-user"
  password: "${VMWARE_PASSWORD}"

database:
  url: "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dora_evidence"

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Usage
```python
from vmware_dora_evidence import DORACollector

# Initialize collector
collector = DORACollector(config_path="config/config.yaml")

# Collect metrics
metrics = collector.collect_all_metrics(days=30)

# Generate report
report = collector.generate_report(metrics, format="html")
```

#### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Collect data
dora-evidence collect --days 30

# Generate report
dora-evidence report --format html --output reports/

# Start daemon
dora-evidence daemon --interval 3600
```

#### REST API
```bash
# Get metrics
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/metrics?days=30" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"

# Generate report
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/reports" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"format": "pdf", "period_days": 30}'
```
